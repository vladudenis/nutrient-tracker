# Nutrient Tracker

Nutrient Tracker is a web application that allows users to input foods they ate in a day and provides an overview of all the nutrients consumed.

If the user is signed in and wishes to save his daily inputs, these will be added to a collection that provides a nutrition weekly, monthly, yearly or custom overview. The user will also be warned in case there are any nutritional deficiencies.
